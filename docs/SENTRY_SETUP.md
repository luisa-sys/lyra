# Sentry Setup (KAN-104)

> The SDK is scaffolded behind a two-flag gate. This doc walks through activating it on each environment.

## What's already shipped (PR #136)

- `@sentry/nextjs` installed
- `instrumentation.ts` — server + edge runtime init, gated on `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` AND `IS_SENTRY_ENABLED='true'`
- `instrumentation-client.ts` — browser init, same gate
- `next.config.ts` wrapped with `withSentryConfig` (source-map upload + tunnel-route off + DE-region CSP)
- 8 unit tests guarding the gate + CSP + auth-token-never-NEXT_PUBLIC

Until both env vars are populated, the SDK is **completely inert** — no network calls, no event capture, no overhead.

## Activating Sentry on an environment

Two steps per env. Recommend doing **dev** first, verifying, then promoting to staging/beta/prod.

### Step 1: Vercel env vars

Vercel → `lyra` project → Settings → Environment Variables. Add the following, scoped to your target env (Development / Preview / Production):

| Variable | Value | Sensitive? | Purpose |
|---|---|---|---|
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_SENTRY_DSN` | `https://1d003e90bf6a072f57d3a7765f124a70@o4511340602523648.ingest.de.sentry.io/4511340621594704` | No | Where the SDK sends events. The `NEXT_PUBLIC_` prefix exposes it to the browser, which is correct — DSN is public-by-design. |
| `IS_SENTRY_ENABLED` | `true` | No | The kill switch. Setting to `false` (or removing) disables Sentry entirely on that env without touching code. |

After saving, redeploy that environment (push a commit or manually trigger via Vercel UI) so the new vars reach the build.

### Step 2: Verify event flow (~30 seconds)

Visit a deliberately-broken route on dev to trigger an error. Easy options:

```bash
# Server-side error: visit any route that throws
curl https://dev.checklyra.com/api/__sentry-test  # 404 — captured as a Next.js NotFoundError

# Client-side error: open dev.checklyra.com in browser, press F12, paste in console:
throw new Error("KAN-104 verification ping " + new Date().toISOString())
```

Then check Sentry → Issues. The event should appear within ~30 seconds. If it doesn't:

1. Hit the URL again and watch the browser DevTools Network tab — you should see a request to `https://*.ingest.de.sentry.io`. If you don't, the SDK didn't initialise — check both env vars are set on the right env.
2. If the network request is there but events don't show in Sentry, the DSN is wrong (typo? rotated?) — check Sentry → Settings → Client Keys (DSN).
3. If events show but the wrong env tag (e.g. dev events tagged `production`), check `VERCEL_ENV` is being set correctly — Vercel sets it automatically per environment.

### Step 3 (optional, do once for source maps): activation for build-time integration

Source maps turn `<minified>:42:13` into `Login.tsx:42:13` in the Sentry UI. This requires three more Vercel env vars set on **Production** (and ideally all envs):

| Variable | Value | Sensitive? | Where to find it |
|---|---|---|---|
| `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` | `sntrys_...` (long token) | **YES** — mark as encrypted in Vercel | Sentry top-right user icon → User Auth Tokens → Create New Token. Scopes: `org:read`, `project:read`, `project:write`, `project:releases` |
| `SENTRY_ORG` | (your org slug) | No | Sentry URL bar when signed in: `https://sentry.io/organizations/[ORG_SLUG]/` |
| `SENTRY_PROJECT` | `lyra` (probably) | No | Sentry → Settings → Projects → click project → URL becomes `/projects/[PROJECT_SLUG]/` |

The token belongs in **Vercel** (where the build runs), not in GitHub Secrets. GitHub-Secrets-only would mean the token never reaches `next build` and source-map upload silently fails.

If `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` is missing or wrong, builds still succeed and events still flow — they just have minified stack traces. Source-map upload errors are caught and logged (not fatal) per the `errorHandler` in `next.config.ts`.

## Rotation

`SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` should be rotated annually (matching the LYRA_RELEASE_PAT cadence). Process:

1. Sentry → User Auth Tokens → Create new token (same scopes)
2. Update `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` in Vercel env vars (each env)
3. Trigger a redeploy on each env to pick up the new token
4. Confirm a fresh deploy uploaded source maps (Sentry → Releases → newest release should show "Source Maps: 0 → N")
5. Revoke the old token in Sentry

The DSN itself doesn't expire and doesn't need rotation unless leaked.

This rotation step is tracked in `docs/SECURITY_ROTATION.md`.

## What's NOT enabled by default

- **Session Replay** (replays of user interactions on errors). Off because:
  - Cost — replay storage is the largest line item on most Sentry bills
  - PII — replay can capture form input, password field values (if not masked), screen contents
  - Enable per-incident only via `replaysSessionSampleRate` + `replaysOnErrorSampleRate` in `instrumentation-client.ts`
- **Tunnel route**. Off because each tunnel-routed event becomes a serverless invocation on Vercel, eating quota fast on a free Sentry plan
- **PII capture** (`sendDefaultPii`). Off — explicit opt-in per Lyra's privacy stance
- **MCP server integration**. The `lyra-mcp-server` repo will get its own `@sentry/node` integration in a separate ticket. KAN-104 is web-app-only.
